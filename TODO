- [BUG REPORT] the web interface only runs on the server it is installed on.
  The ALLOWED_HOSTS and ALLOWED_SERVERS variables in lc.cgi don't work and
  are not (well) documented.

- [BUGFIX] The URL in the log output is double normed.

- [FEATURE] Modernize the CGI HTML pages, use CSS.

- [INTERFACE] make a nice GUI for linkchecker

- [FEATURE] warn if overall size of page (including images/flash/etc.) is
  too big. Right now, the page size is only html content.

- [FEATURE] Option to save/cache downloaded pages.

- [FEATURE] HTML/CSS syntax check

- [FEATURE] Virus check

- [FEATURE] Allow specifying proxy data in the web interface

- [FEATURE] Parse and check URLs from SWF files. Looks like there are no
  Python SWF parsers that I could use for that (2007-12-26), but there
  is a Perl module at http://www.thegestalt.org/flash/stuff/.
  Alternatively just do a strings(1) like search and try to recognize
  URL patterns. Seems to be much easier.
