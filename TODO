Next releases:

- Python 2.4 made socket.sslerror a subclass of socket.error; can we
  use that?

- rethink intern/extern stuff, at least make new option --extern-strict

- recursion into FTP links

- recursion into text files which have one URL per line
  (make a magic for easier detection)

- SF bug #992389 bit me when I wanted to do absolute imports
  at the checker classes :/
  When the bug is fixed we can import absolute classes

- warn if overall size of page (including images/flash/etc.) is too big
  right now, the page size is only html content

- save downloaded pages
