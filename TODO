Possible improvements people could work on:

- Connection pooling. Right now we open for every link a new connection.
  Must be thread-safe, must handle timeouts and connection expiration
  (HTTP: only pool persistent (ie. HTTP/1.1) connections; Keepalive
   header parsing).

- rethink intern/extern stuff

- when an URL is found in the cache and it has a broken anchor, the broken
  anchor name is not displayed as a warning

- Python 2.4 introduced an "usenetrc" option to ignore ~/.netrc for
  NNTP. Thus we could get rid of our custom NNTP class that ignores
  ~/.netrc completely and use "usenetrc=False" instead.

- make a nice GUI for linkchecker

- SF bug #992389 bit me when I wanted to do absolute imports
  at the checker classes :/
  When the bug is fixed we can import absolute classes

- warn if overall size of page (including images/flash/etc.) is too big
  right now, the page size is only html content

- save downloaded pages
