High priority

o Use Python 2.0 features

o I want to be able to supply a "break" command even when multiple
  threads are running.
  The thread implementation of Python is somewhat sparse and does not allow
  suspending/stopping of threads. What I am doing is to call sys.exit(1).

o Parse output and make a site map graphic (PNG format)
  Use an existing layout algorithm.
