High priority

o DNS (and some URLs) seem to hang sometimes. This is not entirely true.
  The SMTP connect has a very long timeout (>200 seconds).
  But I can not use the signal module with threads.
  For convenient timeout setting I have to wait for Python 1.6 and urllib2.

o I want to be able to supply a "break" command even when multiple
  threads are running.
  The thread implementation of Python is somewhat sparse and does not allow
  suspending/stopping of threads. What I am doing is to call sys.exit(1). 
  This kills the entire Python interpreter.

o Internationalization

o Parse GML output and make a site map graphic (PNG format)
