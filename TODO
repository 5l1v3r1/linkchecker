High priority

o DNS (and some URLs) seem to hang sometimes. Why?

o I want to be able to supply a "break" command even when multiple
  threads are running.
  So a thread has to check regularly if a break command was issued? No,
  I do not want this. The thread has to be interrupted from outside, but
  there is at the moment no way to do this with Python threads. What I
  am doing is to call sys.exit(1). This kills the entire Python interpreter.

o Internationalization

o Parse GML output and make a site map graphic (PNG format)

o Blacklist mode: only report links who fail over a certain amount of time
