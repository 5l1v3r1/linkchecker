o A FastCGI script.

o Stable release? Yes, of course. But I have to wait for the
distutils package to stabilize.

o DNS (and some URLs) seem to hang sometimes. Why?

o I want to be able to supply a "break" command even when multiple
threads are running.
So a thread has to check regularly if a break command was issued? No,
I do not want this. The thread has to be interrupted from outside, but
there is at the moment no way how to do this with Python threads. What I
am doing is to call sys.exit(1). This kills the entire Python interpreter.

o Internationalization

o Parse GML output and make a site map graphic (PNG format)
