- queue mutated error (note: press ctrl-c, perhaps only under windows?):
  linkchecker --no-warnings www.cornellcollege.edu
  linkchecker -uatra2005 -paccess --no-warnings --ignore-url=^mailto: www.atra-tr.org

- [FEATURE] postmortem debugging with pdb.pm()

- [BUGFIX] The URL in the log output is double normed.

- [BUGFIX] when an URL is found in the cache and it has a broken anchor,
  the broken anchor name is not displayed as a warning

- [USAGE] make a nice GUI for linkchecker

- [FEATURE] warn if overall size of page (including images/flash/etc.) is
  too big. Right now, the page size is only html content.

- [FEATURE] Option to save downloaded pages. This could also be used to
  build an internal cache, however there are already a plethora of
  caching proxies we could use for that.

> One other problem that I've noticed is that the ignore parameters from the
> configuration file are not used and that both the url-not-normed and the
> url-unnormed do not work as well.
