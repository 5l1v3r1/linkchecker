Next releases:

- logger methods should get called with unicode strings (using
  the unicode-output from the html parser)

- should leading directories of --file-output given filenames be
  created? Right now there is an IOError which is suboptimal.

- use output encoding for loggers

- check unknown encoding config (both command line and config file)

- rethink intern/extern stuff

- when an URL is found in the cache and it has a broken anchor, the broken
  anchor name is not displayed as a warning

- make a nice wxWindows GUI for linkchecker

- SF bug #992389 bit me when I wanted to do absolute imports
  at the checker classes :/
  When the bug is fixed we can import absolute classes

- warn if overall size of page (including images/flash/etc.) is too big
  right now, the page size is only html content

- save downloaded pages
