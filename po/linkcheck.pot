"NOTES\n"
"o A ! before a regular expression negates it. So '!^mailto:' matches\n"
"  everything but a mailto link.\n"
"o URLs on the command line starting with \"ftp.\" are treated like\n"
"  \"ftp://ftp.\", URLs starting with \"www.\" are treated like \"http://www.\".\n"
"  You can also give local files as arguments.\n"
"o If you have your system configured to automatically establish a\n"
"  connection to the internet (e.g. with diald), it will connect when\n"
"  checking links not pointing to your local system.\n"
"  See the --strict option on how to prevent this.\n"
"o Javascript links are currently ignored.\n"
"o If your platform does not support threading, LinkChecker disables it\n"
"  automatically.\n"
"o You can supply multiple user/password pairs in a configuration file.\n"
"o To use proxies set $http_proxy, $https_proxy, $ftp_proxy, $gopher_proxy\n"
"  on Unix or Windows.\n"
"  On a Mac use the Internet Config.\n"
"o When checking 'news:' links the given NNTP host doesn't need to be the\n"
"  same as the host of the user browsing your pages!\n"
