"USAGE\tlinkchecker [options] file-or-url...\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NOTES\n"
"o A ! before any regex negates it. So '!^mailto:' matches everything but\n"
"  a mailto link.\n"
"o LinkCheckers commandline parser treats \"ftp.\" links like \"ftp://ftp.\"\n"
"  and \"www.\" links like \"http://www.\".\n"
"  You can also give local files as arguments.\n"
"o If you have your system configured to automatically establish a\n"
"  connection to the internet (e.g. with diald), it will connect when\n"
"  checking links not pointing to your local host.\n"
"  Use the -s and -i options to prevent this.\n"
"o Javascript links are currently ignored.\n"
"o If your platform does not support threading, LinkChecker uses -t0.\n"
"o You can supply multiple user/password pairs in a configuration file.\n"
"o To use proxies set $http_proxy, $https_proxy, $ftp_proxy, $gopher_proxy\n"
"  on Unix or Windows.\n"
"  On a Mac use the Internet Config.\n"
"o When checking 'news:' links the given NNTP host doesn't need to be the\n"
"  same as the host of the user browsing your pages!\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"EXAMPLES\n"
"o Check the treasure.calvinsplayground.de domain, but don't recurse into\n"
"  links outside of this domain:\n"
"      linkchecker -v -r5 -ohtml -s \\\n"
"       http://treasure.calvinsplayground.de/~calvin/ > sample.html\n"
"\n"
"o Don't connect to mailto: hosts, only check their URL syntax. All other\n"
"  links are checked as usual:\n"
"      linkchecker --intern='!^mailto:' --strict www.mysite.org\n"
"\n"
"o Local files and syntactic sugar on the command line:\n"
"      linkchecker c:\\temp\\test.html\n"
"      linkchecker ../bla.html\n"
"      linkchecker www.myhomepage.de\n"
