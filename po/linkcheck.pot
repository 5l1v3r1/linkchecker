"USAGE\tlinkchecker [options] file-or-url...\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NOTES\n"
"o A ! before a regular expression negates it. So '!^mailto:' matches\n"
"  everything but a mailto link.\n"
"o URLs on the command line starting with \"ftp.\" are treated like\n"
"  \"ftp://ftp.\", URLs starting with \"www.\" are treated like \"http://www.\".\n"
"  You can also give local files as arguments.\n"
"o If you have your system configured to automatically establish a\n"
"  connection to the internet (e.g. with diald), it will connect when\n"
"  checking links not pointing to your local system.\n"
"  See the --extern-strict-all option on how to prevent this.\n"
"o Javascript links are currently ignored.\n"
"o If your platform does not support threading, LinkChecker disables it\n"
"  automatically.\n"
"o You can supply multiple user/password pairs in a configuration file.\n"
"o To use proxies set $http_proxy, $https_proxy, $ftp_proxy, $gopher_proxy\n"
"  on Unix or Windows.\n"
"  On a Mac use the Internet Config.\n"
"o When checking 'news:' links the given NNTP host doesn't need to be the\n"
"  same as the host of the user browsing your pages!\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"EXAMPLES\n"
"The most common use checks the given domain recursively, plus any\n"
"single URL pointing outside of the domain:\n"
"  linkchecker http://treasure.calvinsplayground.de/\n"
"Beware that this checks the whole site which can have several hundred\n"
"thousands URLs. Use the -r option to restrict the recursion depth.\n"
"\n"
"Don't connect to mailto: hosts, only check their URL syntax. All other\n"
"links are checked as usual:\n"
"  linkchecker --intern='!^mailto:' --extern-strict-all www.mysite.org\n"
"\n"
"Checking a local HTML file on Unix:\n"
"  linkchecker ../bla.html\n"
"\n"
"Checking a local HTML file on Windows:\n"
"  linkchecker c:\\temp\\test.html\n"
"\n"
"You can skip the \"http://\" url part if the domain starts with \"www.\":\n"
"  linkchecker www.myhomepage.de\n"
"\n"
"You can skip the \"ftp://\" url part if the domain starts with \"ftp.\":\n"
"  linkchecker -r0 ftp.linux.org\n"
