This is a list of things LinkChecker will *not* do for you.

1) Support JavaScript
   See the FAQ, question Q5.

2) Print unreachable/dead documents of your website.
   This would require
   - file system access to your web repository
   - access to your web server configuration

   You can instead store the linkchecker results in a database
   and look for missing files.

3) HTML/XML syntax checking
   Use the HTML tidy program from http://tidy.sourceforge.net/ .
