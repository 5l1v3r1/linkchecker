This is a list of things LinkChecker *wont* do for you.

1) Support JavaScript
   See the FAQ

2) Print unreachable/dead documents
   This would require
   - file system access to your web repository
   - access to your web server configuration

   You can instead store the linkchecker results in a database
   and look for missing files.

3) HTML/XML syntax checking
   Use the HTML tidy program from www.w3c.org.
