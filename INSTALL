                 LinkChecker installation
                ==========================

Requirements:
You need Python >= 1.5.2 from http://www.python.org/

Optionally packages:
Distutils >= 0.8.3 from http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/ 
OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org/
You will need Perl for Win32 (available from
http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl) if you want to install OpenSSL 
on Windows!


Install with Distutils:
This is the preferred way to install because its the easy way.
If you have the Distutils, run "python setup.py install".
Debian users can build the .deb package with "debian/rules binary".

Install without Distutils:
Adjust the sys.path.append argument in the file 'linkchecker' to point 
to the distribution directory.
Copy 'linkcheck/__init__.py.tmpl' to 'linkcheck/__init__.py' and 
replace $install_data with the distribution directory.
Windows users copy 'linkchecker.bat.tmpl' to 'linkchecker.bat' and
replace $install_scripts with the distribution directory.
After all, put the distribution directory in your path.


Running LinkChecker:
Type "linkchecker" followed by your URLs you want to check.
Type "linkchecker -h" for help.
