                     Installation
                    ==============

Requirements
------------
Python >= 1.5.2 from http://www.python.org/
Distutils >= 0.9.1 from http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/
Python 1.6 includes the Distutils 0.9.1,
Python 2.0 includes the Distutils 1.0.1


Optionally packages
-------------------
OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org/
You will need Perl for Win32 (available from
http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl) if you want to install OpenSSL
on Windows!


Setup
-----
Run "python setup.py config" to configure.
Linux users should run "python setup.py config -lcrypto" to use the SSL 
module.
Run "python setup.py install" to install.
Run "python setup.py --help" for help.
Debian users can build the .deb package with "debian/rules binary" as
root or "fakeroot debian/rules binary" as a normal user.

After installation, the system wide configuration file is in 
<prefix>/share/linkchecker/linkcheckerrc.
Local configuration files are in ~/.linkcheckerrc on Unix platforms.

To run the program type "linkchecker" followed by your URLs you want 
to check.
Type "linkchecker -h" for help.


Note
----
If you want to make your own distribution with "python setup.py sdist",
you will need Distutils >= 0.9.4. Older versions are hanging when
they try to parse the MANIFEST.in file.


(Fast)CGI web interface
-----------------------
The *cgi files are three CGI scripts which you can use to run LinkChecker
with a nice graphical web interface.
You can use and adjust the example HTML files in the lconline directory
to run the script.
1) Choose a CGI script. The simplest is lc.cgi and you need a web server
   with CGI support.
   The scripts lc.fcgi (I tested this a while ago) and lc.sz_fcgi 
   (untested) need a web server with FastCGI support.
2) Copy the script of your choice in the CGI directory.
3) Adjust the "action=..." parameter in lconline/lc_cgi.html
   to point to your CGI script.
4) load the lconline/index.html file, enter an URL and klick on the
   check button
   If something goes wrong, check the error log of your web server.
