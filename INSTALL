                     Installation
                    ==============

Requirements
------------
Python >= 2.0 from http://www.python.org/


Optionally packages
-------------------
OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org/


Setup
-----
Run "python2 setup.py config" to configure.
You can provide additional parameters, for example Linux users
can run "python2 setup.py config -lcrypto" to use the SSL module.
Run "python2 setup.py build" to build.
Run "python2 setup.py install" to install.
Run "python2 setup.py --help" for help.

After installation, the system wide configuration file is in
<prefix>/share/linkchecker/linkcheckerrc.
The local configuration file is ~/.linkcheckerrc on Unix platforms.

To run the program type "linkchecker" followed by your URLs you want
to check.
Type "linkchecker -h" for help.


(Fast)CGI web interface
-----------------------
The *cgi files are three CGI scripts which you can use to run LinkChecker
with a nice graphical web interface.
You can use and adjust the example HTML files in the lconline directory
to run the script.
1) Choose a CGI script. The simplest is lc.cgi and you need a web server
   with CGI support.
   The scripts lc.fcgi (I tested this a while ago) and lc.sz_fcgi
   (untested) need a web server with FastCGI support.
2) Copy the script of your choice in the CGI directory.
3) Adjust the "action=..." parameter in lconline/lc_cgi.html
   to point to your CGI script.
4) load the lconline/index.html file, enter an URL and klick on the
   check button
5) If something goes wrong, check the following:
   a) look in the error log of your web server
   b) be sure that you have enabled CGI support in your web server
      do this by running other CGI scripts from which you know that
      they are working
   c) try to run the lc.cgi script by hand
   d) try the testit() function in the lc.cgi script
