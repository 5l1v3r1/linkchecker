                 LinkChecker installation
                ==========================

Requirements:
You need Python >= 1.5.2 from http://www.python.org/

Optionally packages:
Distutils >= 0.8.3 from http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/ 
OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org/
You will need Perl for Win32 (available from
http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl) if you want to install OpenSSL 
on Windows!


Install with Distutils:
The Distutils package has a lot of install options to tweak and ease
your installation.
To install LinkChecker run "python setup.py install".
Debian users can build the .deb package with "debian/rules binary".

Install without Distutils:
Execute "python install.py" to install LinkChecker in the distribution 
directory.
To use HTTPS, compile the Pyhton module ssl.c, for example with
"gcc -c -I/usr/include/openssl -I/usr/include/python1.5 -g -O2 -fPIC \
ssl.c -o ssl.o"
Put the distribution directory in your path to execute the linkchecker
script from everywhere.


Running LinkChecker:
Type "linkchecker" followed by your URLs you want to check.
Type "linkchecker -h" for help.
