                 LinkChecker installation
                ==========================

Requirements:
You need Python >= 1.5.2
You get Python from http://www.python.org

Optionally packages:
Distutils >= 0.8.1 from http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/ 
OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org


Install with Distutils:
If you have the Distutils, run "python setup.py install".


Install without Distutils:
Adjust the sys.path.append argument in the file 'linkchecker' to point 
to the distribution directory.
Now you can type "python linkchecker" (or on Unix: just "./linkchecker") to 
run LinkChecker.

Running LinkChecker from any directory:
Unix users can put the "linkchecker" script somewhere in a directory in 
their $path.
For Windows users, I included a batch script 'linkchecker.bat'. You have to
adjust the distribution directory in this script to point to the directory
where the 'linkchecker' file is. Now you can copy 'linkchecker.bat' in
a directory in your PATH and run it.
