                     Installation
                    ==============

Requirements
------------
Python >= 2.1 from http://www.python.org/
PyDNS from http://pydns.sourceforge.net/
For HTTPS support you need to compile Python with the SSL _socket
module.


Setup
-----
After installation, the system wide configuration file is in
<prefix>/share/linkchecker/linkcheckerrc.

o Unix platforms
  - open a commandline window and change to the linkchecker-x.x.x
    directory
  - run "python setup.py install" to install
  - run "python setup.py --help" for help about install options


o Windows platforms
  - make sure that python.exe is in your PATH
  - open a commandline window (cmd.exe) and change to the
    linkchecker-x.x.x directory
  - run "python.exe setup.py install" to install
  - run "python.exe setup.py --help" for help about install options


o MacOS 9.x platforms
  - open the Python IDE
  - open the setup.py file
  - run it (click on "Run all")
  - in the popup window, select the "install" command and click "Add"
  - click "Ok"; this will copy files into the Python folder


o MacOS X platforms
  - not tested


(Fast)CGI web interface
-----------------------
The *cgi files are three CGI scripts which you can use to run LinkChecker
with a nice graphical web interface.
You can use and adjust the example HTML files in the lconline directory
to run the script.
1) Choose a CGI script. The simplest is lc.cgi and you need a web server
   with CGI support.
   The scripts lc.fcgi (I tested this a while ago) and lc.sz_fcgi
   (untested) need a web server with FastCGI support.
2) Copy the script of your choice in the CGI directory.
3) Adjust the "action=..." parameter in lconline/lc_cgi.html
   to point to your CGI script.
4) load the lconline/index.html file, enter an URL and klick on the
   check button
5) If something goes wrong, check the following:
   a) look in the error log of your web server
   b) be sure that you have enabled CGI support in your web server
      do this by running other CGI scripts from which you know that
      they are working
   c) try to run the lc.cgi script by hand
   d) try the testit() function in the lc.cgi script
