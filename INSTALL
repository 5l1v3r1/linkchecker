                     Installation
                    ==============

Requirements for Unix/Linux
---------------------------
1. You need a standard GNU development environment with
   a) C compiler (for example the GNU C Compiler gcc)
   b) gettext
2. Python >= 2.3 from http://www.python.org/ with zlib support


Requirements for Windows
------------------------
Direct download links are in brackets.
1. Install the MinGW suite from http://mingw.sourceforge.net.
   Be sure to install in the given order:
   a) MingGW
     [ http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe ]
   b) MSYS
     [ http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/MSYS-1.0.9.exe ]
   c) libiconv
     [ http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/libiconv-1.8.0-2003.02.01-1.exe ]
   d) gettext
     [ http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/gettext-0.11.5-2003.02.01-1.exe ]
2. Install Python >= 2.3 from http://www.python.org/
   [ http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.3.3/Python-2.3.3.exe ]


Setup for Unix/Linux
--------------------
0. Help note
   Run "python setup.py --help" for help about command options
1. Compile Python modules
   Run "python setup.py build" to compile the Python files.
   The CC environment variable is checked before compilation, so you can
   change the default C compiler with "export CC=myccompiler".
2. Install Python modules
   Run "python setup.py install" to install everything.


Setup for Windows
-----------------
0. Install check
   Be sure to have installed all required software listed above.
1. Preparing Python for the MinGW compiler
   Search the file python23.dll in your windows folder.
   After you found it, launch MSYS and do:
   % pexports python23.dll > python23.def
   Then use the dlltool
   % dlltool --dllname python23.dll --def python23.def --output-lib libpython23.a
   The resulting library has to be placed in the same directory as
   python23.lib. (Should be the libs directory under your Python installation
   directory.)
2. Compile gettext translations
   Change to the linkchecker-X.X.X/po directory:
   % make win
3. Compile and install the Python modules
   Start a DOS command shell and change to the linkchecker-X.X.X directory:
   c:> python setup.py build -c mingw32 install


Installation for other platforms
--------------------------------
If you happen to install LinkChecker on other platforms (for example
MacOS 9.x or MacOS X) then drop me a note.


(Fast)CGI web interface
-----------------------
The *cgi files are three CGI scripts which you can use to run LinkChecker
with a nice graphical web interface.
You can use and adjust the example HTML files in the lconline directory
to run the script.
1. Choose a CGI script. The simplest is lc.cgi and you need a web server
   with CGI support.
   The scripts lc.fcgi (I tested this a while ago) and lc.sz_fcgi
   (untested) need a web server with FastCGI support.
2. Copy the script of your choice in the CGI directory.
3. Adjust the "action=..." parameter in lconline/lc_cgi.html
   to point to your CGI script.
4. load the lconline/index.html file, enter an URL and klick on the
   check button
5. If something goes wrong, check the following:
   a) look in the error log of your web server
   b) be sure that you have enabled CGI support in your web server
      do this by running other CGI scripts from which you know that
      they are working
   c) try to run the lc.cgi script by hand
   d) try the testit() function in the lc.cgi script
