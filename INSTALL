                 LinkChecker installation
                ==========================

Requirements:
You need Python >= 1.5.2
You get Python from http://www.python.org

Optionally packages:
Distutils >= 0.8.3 from http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/ 
OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org
You will need Perl for Win32 (available from
http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl) if you want to install OpenSSL 
on Windows!


Install with Distutils:
This is the preferred way to install because its the easy way.
If you have the Distutils, run "python setup.py install".
Debian users can build the .deb package with "debian/rules binary".

Install without Distutils:
Adjust the sys.path.append argument in the file 'linkchecker' to point 
to the distribution directory.
Unix users copy now the 'linkchecker' file to a directory in their $path.
For Windows users, I included a batch script 'linkchecker.bat'. You have to
adjust the directory in this script to point to the directory
where the 'linkchecker' file is. Now you can copy 'linkchecker.bat' in
a directory in your PATH.

Running LinkChecker from any directory:
Type "linkchecker" followed by your URLs you want to check.
Type "linkchecker -h" for help on the commandline syntax.
