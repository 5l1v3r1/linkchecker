Web Interface
==============
The web interface can be configured with
- executing "sudo a2enmod negotiation"
- accessing http://localhost/lconline/

If you want to access to web interface from other
computers, add their IP addresses in the file
/etc/apache2/conf.d/linkchecker

There is a default maximum check time of 5 minutes
per request. After that, checking will be aborted.
If you want to change this limit, look in the file
/usr/share/pyshared/linkcheck/lc_cgi.py and adjust
the variable MAX_REQUEST_SECONDS.
