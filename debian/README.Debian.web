Web Interface
==============
The web interface is at http://localhost/lconline/

If you want to access to web interface from other
computers, add their IP addresses in the file
/etc/apache2/conf-available/linkchecker.conf

There is a default maximum check time of 5 minutes
per request. After that, checking will be aborted.
If you want to change this limit, look in the file
/usr/share/pyshared/linkcheck/lc_cgi.py and adjust
the variable MAX_REQUEST_SECONDS.

For the HTML files in the lconline directory to work, your web server
must have mod_negotiation enabled.

Or you can just remove the .XY suffixes from the language-specific
files.
