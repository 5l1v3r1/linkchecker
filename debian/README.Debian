On Debian systems, you have a simple CGI script located at
http://localhost/lconline/index.html
For this to work, your web server must have content negotiation enabled.
Or you have to remove for one language XY the file extensions of the
.html.XY files.

For installation of a FastCGI script instead of the above, see README.
