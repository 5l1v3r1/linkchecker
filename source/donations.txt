Donations for LinkChecker
===============================

Hopefully LinkChecker has been useful for you and your projects.
In case you are considering to give something back, you can find
here several options to do so.

Paypal

Donating over paypal is the most convenient way if you own a
paypal account.

Bitcoin
========
Transferring 1 BT to `bitcoin account`_
will make the world a more happy place :-)

Amazon wishlist
================
Buying me something from `my amazon wishlist`_ will definitely make
me happy.

Mac OS X hardware
==================
The OS X system I used to develop and generate the `DMG installer`_
is unfortunately no longer available to me.
So unless some really nice people sponsor a Mac for development,
there will be no more DMG installer releases.

.. _DMG installer:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/linkchecker/files/7.0/LinkChecker-7.0.dmg/download

Of course you can always install LinkChecker from source or generate the
installer yourself (see install.txt_). There are also MacPorts_ and
Fink_ entries.

.. _install.txt:
   https://github.com/wummel/linkchecker/blob/master/doc/install.txt
.. _MacPorts:
   https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/www/linkchecker/Portfile
.. _Fink:
   http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/linkchecker

Code
=====
`Check out the code`_, improve it and send me a pull request.
Unleash the power of open source!

Thanks
=======
Regardless which option you are choosing above - thank you for your
support.
It will help me to maintain and improve LinkChecker.
