.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlinkchecker\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIfile-or-url\fP]...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP

recursive checking,
multithreading,
output in colored or normal text, HTML, SQL, CSV or a sitemap
graph in GML or XML,
support for HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, FTP, mailto:, news:, nntp:, Telnet
and local file links,
restriction of link checking with regular expression filters for URLs,
proxy support,
username/password authorization for HTTP and FTP,
robots.txt exclusion protocol support,
i18n support,
a command line interface and
a (Fast)CGI web interface (requires HTTP server)
.
.SH EXAMPLES
The most common use checks the given domain recursively, plus any
URL pointing outside of the domain:
  \fBlinkchecker http://www.example.net/\fP
.br
Beware that this checks the whole site which can have thousands of URLs.
Use the \fB\-r\fP option to restrict the recursion depth.
.br
Don't connect to \fBmailto:\fP hosts, only check their URL syntax. All other
links are checked as usual:
  \fBlinkchecker \-\-ignore\-url=^mailto: mysite.example.org\fP
.br
Checking a local HTML file on Unix:
  \fBlinkchecker ../bla.html\fP
.br
Checking a local HTML file on Windows:
  \fBlinkchecker c:\\temp\\test.html\fP
.br
You can skip the \fBhttp://\fP url part if the domain starts with \fBwww.\fP:
  \fBlinkchecker www.example.com\fP
.br
You can skip the \fBftp://\fP url part if the domain starts with \fBftp.\fP:
  \fBlinkchecker \-r0 ftp.example.org\fP
.br
Generate a sitemap graph and convert it with the graphviz dot utility:
  \fBlinkchecker \-odot \-v www.example.com | dot \-Tps > sitemap.ps\fP
.

You should use the \fB\-\-verbose\fP option to get the complete URL list,
especially when outputting a sitemap graph format.

.TP
\fBtext\fP
Standard text logger, logging URLs in keyword: argument fashion.
.TP
\fBhtml\fP
Log URLs in keyword: argument fashion, formatted as HTML.

\fB~/.linkchecker/blacklist\fP which only contains entries with invalid
URLs and the number of times they have failed.
.TP
\fBnone\fP
Logs nothing. Suitable for debugging or checking the exit code.
.
.SH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
Only Python regular expressions are accepted by LinkChecker.
See \fBhttp://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/\fP for an introduction in
regular expressions.

The only addition is that a leading exclamation mark negates the regular
expression.
.
.SH COOKIE FILES
A cookie file contains standard RFC 805 header data with the following
possible names:
.
.TP
\fBScheme\fP (optional)
Sets the scheme the cookies are valid for; default scheme is \fBhttp\fP.
.TP
\fBHost\fP (required)
Sets the domain the cookies are valid for.
.TP
\fBPath\fP (optional)
Gives the path the cookies are value for; default path is \fB/\fP.
.TP
\fBSet-cookie\fP (optional)
Set cookie name/value. Can be given more than once.
.PP
Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.
.
The example below will send two cookies to all URLs starting with
\fBhttp://example.com/hello/\fP and one to all URLs starting
with \fBhttps://example.org/\fP:

 Host: example.com
 Path: /hello
 Set-cookie: ID="smee"
 Set-cookie: spam="egg"

 Scheme: https
 Host: example.org
 Set-cookie: baggage="elitist"; comment="hologram"

.SH PROXY SUPPORT
To use a proxy on Unix or Windows set the $http_proxy, $https_proxy or $ftp_proxy
environment variables to the proxy URL. The URL should be of the form
\fBhttp://\fP[\fIuser\fP\fB:\fP\fIpass\fP\fB@\fP]\fIhost\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP].
LinkChecker also detects manual proxy settings of Internet Explorer under
Windows systems. On a Mac use the Internet Config to select a proxy.
.
You can also set a comma-separated domain list in the $no_proxy environment
variables to ignore any proxy settings for these domains.
.
Setting a HTTP proxy on Unix for example looks like this:

  export http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"

Proxy authentication is also supported:

  export http_proxy="http://user1:mypass@proxy.example.org:8081"

Setting a proxy on the Windows command prompt:

  set http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080

.SH PERFORMED CHECKS
All URLs have to pass a preliminary syntax test. Minor quoting
mistakes will issue a warning, all other invalid syntax issues
are errors.
After the syntax check passes, the URL is queued for connection
checking. All connection check types are described below.
.
.TP
HTTP links (\fBhttp:\fP, \fBhttps:\fP)
After connecting to the given HTTP server the given path
or query is requested. All redirections are followed, and
if user/password is given it will be used as authorization
when necessary.
Permanently moved pages issue a warning.
All final HTTP status codes other than 2xx are errors.
.
HTML page contents are checked for recursion.
.TP
Local files (\fBfile:\fP)
A regular, readable file that can be opened is valid. A readable
directory is also valid. All other files, for example device files,
unreadable or non-existing files are errors.
.
HTML or other parseable file contents are checked for recursion.
.TP
Mail links (\fBmailto:\fP)
A mailto: link eventually resolves to a list of email addresses.
If one address fails, the whole list will fail.
For each mail address we check the following things:
.
  1) Check the adress syntax, both of the part before and after
     the @ sign.
  2) Look up the MX DNS records. If we found no MX record,
     print an error.
  3) Check if one of the mail hosts accept an SMTP connection.
     Check hosts with higher priority first.
     If no host accepts SMTP, we print a warning.
  4) Try to verify the address with the VRFY command. If we got
     an answer, print the verified address as an info.
.TP
FTP links (\fBftp:\fP)
  
  For FTP links we do:
  
  1) connect to the specified host
  2) try to login with the given user and password. The default
     user is ``anonymous``, the default password is ``anonymous@``.
  3) try to change to the given directory
  4) list the file with the NLST command

- Telnet links (``telnet:``)
  
  We try to connect and if user/password are given, login to the
  given telnet server.

- NNTP links (``news:``, ``snews:``, ``nntp``)
  
  We try to connect to the given NNTP server. If a news group or
  article is specified, try to request it from the server.

- Ignored links (``javascript:``, etc.)
  
  An ignored link will only print a warning. No further checking
  will be made.
  
  Here is a complete list of recognized, but ignored links. The most
  prominent of them should be JavaScript links.
  
  - ``acap:``      (application configuration access protocol)

.SH RECURSION
Before descending recursively into a URL, it has to fulfill several
conditions. They are checked in this order:

1. A URL must be valid.

2. A URL must be parseable. This currently includes HTML files,
   Opera bookmarks files, and directories. If a file type cannot
   be determined (for example it does not have a common HTML file
   extension, and the content does not look like HTML), it is assumed
   to be non-parseable.

3. The URL content must be retrievable. This is usually the case
   except for example mailto: or unknown URL types.

4. The maximum recursion level must not be exceeded. It is configured
   with the ``--recursion-level`` option and is unlimited per default.

5. It must not match the ignored URL list. This is controlled with
   the ``--ignore-url`` option.

6. The Robots Exclusion Protocol must allow links in the URL to be
   followed recursively. This is checked by searching for a
   "nofollow" directive in the HTML header data.

Note that the directory recursion reads all files in that
directory, not just a subset like ``index.htm*``.

.SH NOTES
URLs on the commandline starting with \fBftp.\fP are treated like
\fBftp://ftp.\fP, URLs starting with \fBwww.\fP are treated like
\fBhttp://www.\fP.
You can also give local files as arguments.

If you have your system configured to automatically establish a
connection to the internet (e.g. with diald), it will connect when
checking links not pointing to your local host.
Use the \fB\-s\fP and \fB\-i\fP options to prevent this.

Javascript links are currently ignored.

If your platform does not support threading, LinkChecker disables it
automatically.

You can supply multiple user/password pairs in a configuration file.

When checking \fBnews:\fP links the given NNTP host doesn't need to be the
same as the host of the user browsing your pages.
.
