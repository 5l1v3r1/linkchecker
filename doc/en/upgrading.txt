Upgrading
=========

Migrating from 2.x to 3.0
-------------------------

The --warnings option is deprecated since warnings are now printed
per default. A new --no-warnings has been added if one wants to
have the old behaviour. Additionally, some old warnings about have
been removed.

The previously deprecated --status option has been removed.

The options --intern, --extern and --extern-strict have been replaced
by --ignore-url and --no-follow-url.

The configuration file format has changed. See the distributed
linkcheckerrc default config for the new syntax.


Migrating from 2.2 to 2.3
-------------------------

The per-user config file is now ``~/.linkchecker/linkcheckerrc``
(previous location was ``~/.linkcheckerrc`` ).

The default blacklist output file is now ``~/.linkchecker/blacklist``
(previous location was ``~/.blacklist``).

Python >= 2.4 is now required.


Migrating from 1.x to 2.0
-------------------------

The --output and --file-output parameters can specify the encoding
now. You should check your scripts if they support the new option
syntax.

Some added checks might trigger new warnings, so automated scripts
or alarms can have more output than with 1.x releases.

All output (file and console) is now encoded according to a given
character set encoding which defaults to ISO-8859-15. If you
relied that output was in a specific encoding, you might want to
use the output encoding option.


Migrating from 1.12.x to 1.13.0
-------------------------------

Since lots of filenames have changed you should check that any
manually installed versions prior to 1.13.0 are removed. Otherwise
you will have startup problems.

The default output logger ``text`` has now colored output if the
output terminal supports it. The old ``colored`` output logger has
been removed.

The ``-F`` option no longer suppresses normal output. The old behaviour
can be restored by giving the option ``-onone``.

The --status option is now the default and has been deprecated. The
old behaviour can be restored by giving the option ``--no-status``.

The default recursion depth is now infinite. The old behaviour
can be restored by giving the option ``--recursion-level=1``.

The option ``--strict`` has been renamed to ``--extern-strict-all``.

The commandline program ``linkchecker`` returns now non-zero exit value
when errors were encountered. Previous versions always return a zero
exit value.
For scripts to ignore exit values and therefore restore the old behaviour
you can append a ``|| true`` at the end of the command.
