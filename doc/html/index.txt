## Basic usage

To check a URL like ``http://www.example.org/`` it is enough to
type ``linkchecker www.example.org/`` on the command line or
type ``www.example.org`` in the GUI application. This will check the
complete domain of ``http://www.example.org`` recursively. All links
pointing outside of the domain are also checked for validity.

## Performed checks

All URLs have to pass a preliminary syntax test. Minor quoting
After the syntax check passes, the URL is queued for connection
checking. All connection check types are described below.

- HTTP links (``http:``, ``https:``)
  
  After connecting to the given HTTP server the given path
  or query is requested. All redirections are followed, and
  if user/password is given it will be used as authorization
  when necessary.
  Permanently moved pages issue a warning.
  All final HTTP status codes other than 2xx are errors.

- Local files (``file:``)
  
  A regular, readable file that can be opened is valid. A readable
  directory is also valid. All other files, for example device files,
  unreadable or non-existing files are errors.
  
  File contents are checked for recursion.
  
- Mail links (``mailto:``)
  
  A mailto: link eventually resolves to a list of email addresses.
  If one address fails, the whole list will fail.
  For each mail address the following things are checked:
  
  1. Check the adress syntax, both of the part before and after
     the @ sign.
  2. Look up the MX DNS records. If no MX record is found,
     print an error.
  3. Check if one of the mail hosts accept an SMTP connection.
     Check hosts with higher priority first.
     If no host accepts SMTP, a warning is printed.
  4. Try to verify the address with the VRFY command. If there is
     an answer, the verified address is printed as an info.

- FTP links (``ftp:``)
  
  For FTP links the following is checked:
  
  1. Connect to the specified host.
  2. Try to login with the given user and password. The default
     user is ``anonymous``, the default password is ``anonymous@``.
  3. Try to change to the given directory.
  4. List the file with the NLST command.

- Telnet links (``telnet:``)
  
  A connect and if user/password are given, login to the
  given telnet server is tried.

- NNTP links (``news:``, ``snews:``, ``nntp``)
  
  A connect is tried to connect to the given NNTP server. If a news group or
  article is specified, it will be requested from the server.

- Ignored links (``javascript:``, etc.)
  
  An ignored link will print a warning, but no error. No further checking
  will be made.
  
  Here is the complete list of recognized, but ignored links. The most
  prominent of them are JavaScript links.
  
  - ``acap:``      (application configuration access protocol)

  - ``ldap:``      (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
  - ``mailserver:`` (Access to data available from mail servers)
  - ``mid:``       (message identifier)
  - ``mms:``       (multimedia stream)
  - ``modem:``     (modem)

  - ``pop:``       (Post Office Protocol v3)
  - ``prospero:``  (Prospero Directory Service)
  - ``rsync:``     (rsync protocol)
  - ``rtsp:``      (real time streaming protocol)
  - ``service:``   (service location)
  - ``shttp:``     (secure HTTP)
  - ``sip:``       (session initiation protocol)
  - ``tel:``       (telephone)
  - ``tip:``       (Transaction Internet Protocol)
  - ``tn3270:``    (Interactive 3270 emulation sessions)
  - ``vemmi:``     (versatile multimedia interface)
  - ``wais:``      (Wide Area Information Servers)
  - ``z39.50r:``   (Z39.50 Retrieval)
  - ``z39.50s:``   (Z39.50 Session)


## Recursion

Before descending recursively into a URL, it has to fulfill several
conditions. The conditions are checked in this order:

1. The URL must be valid.
2. The URL must be parseable. This currently includes HTML files,
   Opera bookmarks files, and directories. If a file type cannot
   be determined (for example it does not have a common HTML file
   extension, and the content does not look like HTML), it is assumed
   to be non-parseable.
3. The URL content must be retrievable. This is usually the case
   except for example mailto: or unknown URL types.
4. The maximum recursion level must not be exceeded. It is configured
   with the ``--recursion-level`` command line option, the recursion
   level GUI option, or through the configuration file.
   The recursion level is unlimited by default.
5. It must not match the ignored URL list. This is controlled with
   the ``--ignore-url`` command line option or through the
   configuration file.
6. The Robots Exclusion Protocol must allow links in the URL to be
   followed recursively. This is checked by searching for a
   "nofollow" directive in the HTML header data.

Note that the local and FTP directory recursion reads all files in that
directory, not just a subset like ``index.htm*``.


## Configuration files

There are two locations where LinkChecker looks for configuration files.
The first is the system configuration file which is valid for all users.
The second is the user configuration file which can be adjusted
by the current user.

On Unix systems the locations are

- ``/etc/linkchecker/linkcheckerrc`` (system configuration)
- ``~/.linkchecker/linkcheckerrc`` (user configuration)

On Windows the locations are

- ``%ProgramFiles%\linkchecker\share\linkchecker\linkcheckerrc`` (system
  configuration)
- ``%HOMEPATH%\.linkchecker\linkcheckerrc`` (user configuration)
