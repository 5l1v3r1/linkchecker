# Options

## GUI options
The most common check options are configurable.
They override any configuration file settings.

### Recursive depth
Check recursively all links up to given depth.
A negative depth will enable infinite recursion.

### Verbose output
Log all checked URLs once. Default is to log only errors and warnings.

### Debug
Log debugging output for each check.
It can be displayed with Help->Show Debug

## Configuration files
The configuration files can be edited with an integrated text editor.
