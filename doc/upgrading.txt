Upgrading
=========

Migrating from 1.12.x to 1.13.0
-------------------------------

Since lots of filenames have changed you should check that any
manually installed versions prior to 1.13.0 are removed. Otherwise
you will have startup problems.

The default output logger ``text`` has now colored output if the
output terminal supports it.

The ``-F`` option no longer suppresses normal output. The old behaviour
can be restored by giving the option ``-onone``.

The --status option is now the default and has been deprecated. The
old behaviour can be restored by giving the option ``--no-status``.

The default recursion depth is now infinite. The old behaviour
can be restored by giving the option ``--recursion-level=1``.

The option ``--strict`` has been renamed to ``--extern-strict-all``.

The commandline program ``linkchecker`` returns now non-zero exit value
when errors were encountered. Previous versions always return a zero
exit value.
For scripts to ignore exit values and therefore restore the old behaviour
you can append a ``|| true`` at the end of the command.
