Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

**Q: LinkChecker produced an error, but my web page is ok with
Netscape/IE/Opera/...
Is this a bug in LinkChecker?**

A: Please check your web pages first. Are they really ok? Use
a syntax highlighting editor! Use HTML Tidy from www.w3c.org!
Check if you are using a proxy which produces the error.


**Q: I still get an error, but the page is definitely ok.**

A: Some servers deny access of automated tools (also called robots)
like LinkChecker. This is not a bug in LinkChecker but rather a
policy by the webmaster running the website you are checking.
It might even be possible for a website to send robots different
web pages than normal browsers.


**Q: How can I tell LinkChecker which proxy to use?**

A: LinkChecker works transparently with proxies. In a Unix or Windows
environment, set the http_proxy, https_proxy, ftp_proxy or gopher_proxy
environment variables to a URL that identifies the proxy server before
starting LinkChecker. For example
# http_proxy="http://www.someproxy.com:3128"
# export http_proxy

In a Macintosh environment, LinkChecker will retrieve proxy information
from Internet Config.


**Q: The link "mailto:john@company.com?subject=Hello John" is reported
as an error.**

A: You have to quote special characters (e.g. spaces) in the subject field.
The correct link should be "mailto:...?subject=Hello%20John"
Unfortunately browsers like IE and Netscape do not enforce this.


**Q: Has LinkChecker JavaScript support?**

A: No, it never will. If your page is not working without JS then your
web design is broken.
Use PHP or Zope or ASP for dynamic content, and use JavaScript just as
an addon for your web pages.


**Q: I have a pretty large site to check. How can I restrict link checking
to check only my own pages?**

A: Look at the options --intern, --extern, --strict, --denyallow  and
--recursion-level.


**Q: I don't get this --extern/--intern stuff.**

A: When it comes to checking there are three types of URLs:

1) strict external URLs:
   We do only syntax checking. Internal URLs are never strict.
2) external URLs:
   Like 1), but we additionally check if they are valid by connect()ing
   to them
3) internal URLs:
   Like 2), but we additionally check if they are HTML pages and if so,
   we descend recursively into this link and check all the links in the
   HTML content.
   The --recursion-level option restricts the number of such recursive
   descends.

LinkChecker provides four options which affect URLs to fall in one
of those three categories: --intern, --extern, --strict and
--denyallow.
By default all URLs are internal. With --extern you specify what URLs
are external. With --intern you specify what URLs are internal.
Now imagine you have both --extern and --intern. What happens
when an URL matches both patterns? Or when it matches none? In this
situation the --denyallow option specifies the order in which we match
the URL. By default it is internal/external, with --denyallow the order is
external/internal. Either way, the first match counts, and if none matches,
the last checked category is the category for the URL.
Finally, with --strict all external URLs are strict.

Oh, and just to boggle your mind: you can have more than one external
regular expression in a config file and for each of those expressions
you can specify if those matched external URLs should be strict or not.

An example. Assume we want to check only urls of our domains named
'mydomain.com' and 'myotherdomain.com'. Then we specify
-i'^http://my(other)?domain\.com' as internal regular expression, all other
urls are treated external. Easy.

Another example. We don't want to check mailto urls. Then its
-i'!^mailto:'. The '!' negates an expression. With --strict, we don't
even connect to any mail hosts.

Yet another example. We check our site www.mycompany.com, don't recurse
into external links point outside from our site and want to ignore links to
hollowood.com and hullabulla.com completely.
This can only be done with a configuration entry like
[filtering]
extern1=hollowood.com 1
extern2=hullabulla.com 1
# the 1 means strict external ie don't even connect
and the command
linkchecker --intern=www.mycompany.com www.mycompany.com


**Q: Is LinkCheckers cookie feature insecure?**

A: Cookies can not store more information as is in the HTTP request itself,
so you are not giving away any more system information.
After storing however, the cookies are sent out to the server on request.
Not to every server, but only to the one who the cookie originated from!
This could be used to "track" subsequent requests to this server,
and this is what some people annoys (including me).
Cookies are only stored in memory. After LinkChecker finishes, they
are lost. So the tracking is restricted to the checking time.
The cookie feature is disabled as default.


**Q: I want to have my own logging class. How can I use it in LinkChecker?**

A: Currently, only a Python API lets you define new logging classes.
Define your own logging class as a subclass of StandardLogger or any other
logging class in the log module.
Then call the addLogger function in Config.Configuration to register
your new Logger.
After this append a new Logging instance to the fileoutput.

import linkcheck, MyLogger
log_format = 'mylog'
log_args = {'fileoutput': log_format, 'filename': 'foo.txt'}
cfg = linkcheck.Config.Configuration()
cfg.addLogger(log_format, MyLogger.MyLogger)
cfg['fileoutput'].append(cfg.newLogger(log_format, log_args)) 


**Q: LinkChecker does not ignore anchor references on caching.**

**Q: Some links with anchors are getting checked twice.**

A: This is not a bug.
It is common practice to believe that if an URL ABC#anchor1 works then
ABC#anchor2 works too. That is not specified anywhere and I have seen
server-side scripts that fail on some anchors and not on others.
This is the reason for always checking URLs with different anchors.
If you really want to disable this, use --no-anchor-caching.


**Q: I see LinkChecker gets a "/robots.txt" file for every site it
checks. What is that about?**

A: LinkChecker follows the robots.txt exclusion standard. To avoid
misuse of LinkChecker, you cannot turn this feature off.
See http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html and
http://www.w3.org/Search/9605-Indexing-Workshop/ReportOutcomes/Spidering.txt
for more info.


**Q: Ctrl-C does not stop LinkChecker immediately. Why is that so?**

A: The Python interpreter has to wait for all threads to finish, and
this means waiting for all open sockets to close. The default timeout
for sockets is 30 seconds, hence the delay.
You can change the default socket timeout with the --timeout option.
This is a list of things LinkChecker will *not* do for you.


**Q: Print unreachable/dead documents of your website.**

A: This would require
- file system access to your web repository
- access to your web server configuration

You can instead store the linkchecker results in a database
and look for missing files.

**Q: HTML/XML syntax checking**

A: Use the HTML tidy program from http://tidy.sourceforge.net/ .
