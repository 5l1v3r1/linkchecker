Credits go to Guido van Rossum for making Python. His hovercraft is
full of eels!
As this program is directly derived from my Java link checker, additional
credits go to Robert Forsman (the author of JCheckLinks) and his
robots.txt parse algorithm.
I want to thank everybody who gave me feedback, bug reports and
suggestions.

Versioning:
Version numbers have the same meaning as Linux Kernel version numbers.
The first number is the major package version. The second number is
the minor package version. An odd second number stands for development
versions, an even number for stable version. The third number is a
package release sequence number.
So for example 1.1.5 is the fifth release of the 1.1 development package.

Included packages:
httplib from http://www.lyra.org/greg/python/
httpslib from http://home.att.net/~nvsoft1/ssl_wrapper.html
DNS see DNS/README
distutils from http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/
