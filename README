Credits go to Guido van Rossum for making Python. His hovercraft is
full of eels!
As this program is directly derived from my Java link checker, additional
credits go to Robert Forsman (the author of JCheckLinks) and his
robots.txt parse algorithm.

I want to thank everybody who gave me feedback, bug reports and
suggestions.
