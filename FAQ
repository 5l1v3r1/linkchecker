Q: The link "mailto:john@company.com?subject=Hello John" is reported
   as an error.
A: You have to quote special characters (e.g. spaces) in the subject field.
   The correct link should be "mailto:...?subject=Hello%20John"
   Unfortunately browsers like IE and Netscape do not enforce this.


Q: I have a pretty large site to check. How can I restrict link checking
   to check only my own pages?
A: Look at the options --intern, --extern, --strict and --recursion-level.
