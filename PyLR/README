You must have python 1.5b1 or newer to run PyLR, as it works with the
builtin package support of that version.

To build:

1) decide whether you want the PyLRengine module to be a shared library.  
If not, comment out the '*shared*' line  in Setup.

2)type make -f Makefile boot; make

that should build the package. 


To install:

If you want to install PyLR in your python distribution, just copy
over the PyLR directory to your site-packages directory.  If you want
to save a little space, take a look at the __init__ file doc string in
the top directory and it shows the necessary files (distribution minus
Makefile, sedscript, etc).  Also, there is a script (pgen.py) you may want
in /usr/local/bin or something more accessible as executable from your shell.

There is html documentation in the doc/ directory.



To test:

pgen.py PyLR/tstpspec tst
diff tst PyLR/Parsers/gram.py

the only difference should be the date line.
